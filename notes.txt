GraphQL

###
Idea:

/graphql/pdf
( render(url: 'http://reddit.com/') ) 
- should return URL to S3, where PDF will be rendered
- should retutn PDF token, to retrieve pdf in future

( render(url: 'http://reddit.com/', ttl: "20m") ) 
- ttl: means how long until PDF is deleted from S3

( render(url: 'http://reddit.com/', ttl: "20m", filename: 'invoice.pdf') ) 
- filename: the file under which goes the PDF

( pdf(token: '893274n23kj4i8') )
- should return status: ready/processing
- if ready, then it should also return URL to processed file

###

When setting up a server, you should pass S3 credentials in config file.
You should be able to set default ttl.
